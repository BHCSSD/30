# 4.2.4 Visualizing Code Execution

## Python Tutor

Python Tutor is an online tool that helps you see how code runs, one step at a time 
    
* It is especially useful for **understanding variables, functions, and loops**.

**Put each example into Python Tutor to observe the execution.**

## Example 1: Variable Changes

This example shows how variable values **change line by line** in the Global Frame

```python
x = 1
y = 2
print(x + y)
x *= 10
print(x + y)
```

---

## Example 2: Function Calls and Scopes

This demonstrates how **function calls** work and how the program state changes.

```python
def f(x, d):
    x *= 10
    return x + d

x = 123
y = f(x, 4)
print(x, y)
```

> **Main Idea:** Notice that the variable `x` inside the function `f` is **separate** from the global variable `x`. The function call creates a separate **frame** for its local variables.

-----

## Example 3: Loops and Nested Calls

This shows how **loops**, **random values**, and **nested function calls** (a function calling another function) are visualized.

```python
import random

def g(x):
    n = random.randrange(10)
    return x + n

def f(x):
    result = 0
    for i in range(x):
        result += g(i)
    return result

print(f(3))
```

  * **main idea:** Each function call (`f`, then `g`) creates a **new frame** showing its local variables (`x`, `d`, `n`, `result`, `i`).

## Checkpoint

**Which of the following is NOT true about code execution visualizations in Python Tutor?**

* A.  The next line to be executed has a red background
* B.  Global variables, functions, and imported modules all appear in the global frame
* C.  The green arrow points at the line that just executed
* D.  Each function call gets its own frame

  <details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  **C. The green arrow points at the line that just executed.**

    * In Python Tutor, the **green arrow** points to the line that was **just executed (finished)**.
    * The **red arrow** points to the **next line** that is about to be executed.
