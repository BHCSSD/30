## **4.2.9 List-Related String Methods**

These methods technically belong to **strings**, but they are the "glue" that allows you to move data between string format and list format.

---

### `split()` and `splitlines()`

* `s.split(sep)` Breaks a string `s` into a **list of strings**, using `sep` as the boundary
* If you don't provide a separator (e.g. `s.split()`), it automatically splits by **any whitespace** (spaces, tabs, newlines)

  ```python
  # Splitting by a specific character
  names = 'Fred,Wilma,Betty'
  nameList = names.split(',') # seperate on ANY commas, useful, very useful
  print(nameList)  # ['Fred', 'Wilma', 'Betty']

  # Splitting by whitespace (the default)
  sentence = "Python is fun"
  words = sentence.split() 
  print(words)     # ['Python', 'is', 'fun']

  ```

* `s.splitlines()` A specialized version that splits a string at **line breaks** (`\n`). This is much cleaner than using `split('\n')` when dealing with large blocks of text

  ```python
  text = '''Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3'''
  lines = text.splitlines()
  print(lines) # ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']

  ```

### `.join()`

This one is often confusing because it feels "backwards." You call the method on the **separator string**, not the list.

* `sep.join(L)` Takes a **list of strings** `L` and glues them together into one string, placing `sep` between every item

  ```python
  L = ['Fred', 'Wilma', 'Betty']

  # The separator comes FIRST
  print(','.join(L))      # 'Fred,Wilma,Betty'
  print(' and '.join(L))  # 'Fred and Wilma and Betty'
  print(''.join(L))       # 'FredWilmaBetty' (No separator)

  ```

> [!WARNING]
> `.join()` only works if the list contains **strings**. If you try to join a list of integers like `[1, 2, 3]`, Python will throw a `TypeError`

### **Checkpoint**

1. Which of the following is **False**?

* A. For any non-empty string `s` that does not end in a newline, `s.split('\n') == s.splitlines()` is always True
* B. For a multiline string `s` that does not end in a newline, if `L = s.splitlines()`, then `s == '\n'.join(L)` must be True
* C. If `L` is a list of names, then `','.join(L)` will be a comma-separated string of those names
* D. For any list `L`, if `s = '-'.join(L)`, then `'-' in s` must be True

  <blockquote>
  <b>D. For any list <code>L</code>, if <code>s = '-'.join(L)</code>, then <code>'-' in s</code> must be True.</b>

  If the list <code>L</code> has <b>fewer than two elements</b> (like <code>['A']</code> or <code>[]</code>), there is nothing to join "between."
  <ul>
  <li><code>'-'.join(['A'])</code> results in <code>'A'</code> (No dash!)</li>
  <li><code>'-'.join([])</code> results in <code>''</code> (No dash!)</li>
  </ul>
  Therefore, the dash isn't guaranteed to be in the final string

> [!NOTE]
> **TLDR:** 
> 1. `split()` turns **String into List**.
> 2. `join()` turns **List into String**.
> 3. Remember: `separator.join(list_of_strings)`. The separator is the leader
