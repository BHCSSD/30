# Loops & Dictionaries
---

## Part 1: Dictionaries (Key–Value Pairs)

Think of a dictionary like a real-life contact list.
You don’t look up a phone number by its position (index); you look it up by a **name (key)** to find the **number (value)**.

---

### How Dictionaries Work

```python
# 1. Creating a dictionary
hero = {
    "name": "Peter Parker",
    "alias": "Spider Man",
    "level": 10
}

# 2. Getting data
print(hero["alias"])              # Output: Spider Man
print(hero.get("power", "N/A"))   # Safe lookup with a default value

# 3. Adding & updating values
hero["level"] = 11                # Update an existing key
hero["city"] = "NYC"              # Add a new key-value pair

# 4. Removing data
del hero["level"]                 # Removes the 'level' key
```

> **TODO 1**
> Create a dictionary called `car` with the keys `brand`, `model`, and `year`.
> Then write **one line of code** that changes the `year` to `2024`.

## Part 2: Loops (Doing Things Repeatedly)



### The `for` Loop (Definite / Counting Loop)

Use a `for` loop when:

* You have a list of items
* You know how many times the loop should run

```python
# Looping through a list
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]

for thing in fruits:
    print(f"Eating a {thing}")
```

```python
# Using range()
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Counting: {i}")   # Prints 0 through 4
```

---

### The `while` Loop (Conditional Loop)

Use a `while` loop when:

* You don’t know how many times the loop will run
* The loop should continue until a condition becomes **False**

```python
battery = 3

while battery > 0:
    print("Phone is ON")
    battery -= 1   # Always update the condition!

print("Phone died!")
```

> **TODO 2**
> Create a `while` loop that starts at `10` and counts down to `0`.
> Print **"Blast off!"** only when the number reaches `0`.

---

## Part 3: Loop Control (`break` & `continue`)

Sometimes you need to control how a loop behaves *while it’s running*.

* **`break`**  Stop the loop immediately
* **`continue`**  Skip the current iteration and move on

```python
# Example: Stop when we reach 5
for num in range(1, 10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    print(num)
```

> **TODO 3**
> Write a `for` loop that prints numbers `1` to `10`,
> but uses `continue` to **skip** the number `7`.

## The Grocery List

Put everything together by writing a script that:

1. Creates an empty dictionary called `grocery_cart`
2. Uses a `while` loop to ask the user for:

   * An **item name**
   * Its **price**
3. Stores each item in the dictionary
4. Ends the loop when the user types `"stop"`
5. Uses a `for` loop to print a receipt in this format:

```
Item: [Name] | Price: $[Price]
```
