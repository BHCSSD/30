# **4.2.2 Creating Lists in Python**

You can create lists in several ways depending on whether you know the data upfront or need Python to generate it for you

---

## **1. List Literals**

* A **list literal** is written directly in your code using square brackets `[ ]`
  * It can hold any data type, including mixed types within the same list 
  * review `bool`,`str`,`float`,`int`

### **Populated List**

* Use this when you already know exactly what values should be in the list

  ```python
  L = [42, True, 'wahoo']
  print(L)               # [42, True, 'wahoo']
  print(len(L))          # 3 (number of items)
  print(type(L) == list) # True 

  ```

### **Empty List**

* Empty lists are often used as a starting point that you will add information to later

  ```python
  L = []
  print(L)               # []
  print(len(L))          # 0

  ```

---

## **2. Using the `list()` Function**

* The `list()` function is a built-in constructor. When called with no arguments, it creates a brand-new **empty list**

  ```python
  L = list()
  print(L)       # []
  print(len(L))  # 0

  ```

> [!TIP]
> **Variable Naming:**
> Use a capital `L` for list variables. A lowercase `l` looks almost identical to the number `1` or a capital `I` in many fonts, which leads to bugs

---

## **3. Variable-Length Lists**

* Sometimes you need a list of a specific size, but you don't want to type out every single element

### **A. The `*` Operator (Repetition)**

* You can use the multiplication operator to "multiply" a single-element list into a larger one

  ```python
  # Create a list of three zeros
  L = [0] * 3
  print(L)       # [0, 0, 0]

  # Using a variable for the length
  n = 5
  L = [42] * n
  print(L)       # [42, 42, 42, 42, 42]

  ```

### **B. `list(range(n))` (Consecutive Integers)**

* The `range()` function generates numbers, but it doesn't create a list on its own. You must "wrap" it in the `list()` function to convert those numbers into an actual list
  *  syntax `range(start, stop, step) ` 

  ```python
  n = 5
  L = list( range(n) ) 
  print(L)       # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
  print(len(L))  # 5

  ```

## Checkpoint

**Which of the following does NOT create a list of length 4?**

* A.  `[2, 6, 8, 15]`
* B. `list( range(0, 20, 5) )`
* C. `[42] * 4`
* D. `range(2, 6)`

  <details>
  <summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

  **D.** `range(2, 6)`

  * **Why?** The `range()` function creates a **range object**, which is a special type of "generator." While it behaves like a list in a `for` loop, it is NOT a list. To make it a list, you must use `list(range(2, 6))`.
  * **Breakdown of others:**
  A. `[2, 6, 8, 15]` 
  B. `list(range(0, 20, 5))` creates `[0, 5, 10, 15]` 
  C. `[42] * 4` creates `[42, 42, 42, 42]`
