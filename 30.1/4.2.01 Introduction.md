# **4.2.1 Introduction to Lists**

A list is a **mutable** (it can change), **ordered** collection of values. It lets you store multiple items which can be of different data types, insdie a single variable.

### 1. Basic Structure

* Lists are define with `[ ]`
* Elements are separated by commas
* The Data type of a list object is always `list`

    ```python
    # A list with 3 different data types
    my_list = [1, True, 'yes']
    
    print( type(my_list) ) 
    # Check the type ... SOMETHING NEW
    print( type(my_list) == list  )  # True  my_list is truely actually a list

    ```

### 2. Accessing Elements (Indexing)

To get a specific value out of a list, use its index. 
* Python uses **zero based indexing**, 
    * meaning the first item is at index `0`
* **Positive Indexing:** Counts from the front (`0` to `length - 1`)
* **Negative Indexing:** Counts from the back (`-1` is the last item in the list)

    ```python
    L = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

    print(L[0])   # 'red'
    print(L[-1])  # 'blue'

    ```

### **3. Editing Elements (Mutation)**

* Because lists are **mutable**, you can change a specific element by assigning a new value to its index

    ```python
    L = ['bread', 'milk', 'eggs']

    # Change 'milk' to 'cheese'
    L[1] = 'cheese'

    print(L)  # ['bread', 'cheese', 'eggs']

    ```

### **4. List Properties**

* **Empty Lists:** A list can have no elements 
    * often used as a starting point to add data later
    ```python
    empty_list = []

    ```


* **Length:** Use the `len()` function to see how many items are in a list
    ```python
    L = [10, 20, 30]
    print( len(L) )  # 3

    ```



> [!WARNING]
> **IndexError:** If you try to access or edit an index that does not exist (e.g. `L[5]` for a list of length 3), Python will crash with an `IndexError: list index out of range`
